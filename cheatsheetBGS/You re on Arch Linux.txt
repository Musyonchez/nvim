You're on **Arch Linux** with a **Dell Latitude E7240**, and your specs are **surprisingly solid** for your goal:

* ✅ **16 GB RAM**
* ✅ **i5-4300U (4 threads)**
* ✅ **Intel HD 4400 (basic but sufficient)**
* ✅ **256 GB SSD**
* ✅ **Wayland + GNOME 48**
* ✅ **Arch rolling** (bleeding edge tools)

And your **goal** is to:

> 🎥 **Record yourself coding/studying for hours**, then **edit and upload to YouTube** for accountability.

This is an excellent method — many productivity YouTubers do this (Pomodoro-style, live streams, study with me, etc.).

## 🧠 Recommended Workflow for Long-Form Accountability Videos

### 1. **Recording Software**

You’ll need lightweight screen recording + webcam combo.

#### 🎥 [OBS Studio (with optimization)](https://obsproject.com/)

* ✅ Records screen + webcam + mic
* 🔧 Use **x264** or **VAAPI (Intel)** encoding
* 🎚️ Lower bitrate, disable preview, record at 720p
* 📦 Install:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S obs-studio
  ```

#### ⚙️ OBS Settings (Optimized for your CPU/GPU):

* Output: `mp4` or `mkv`
* Encoder: `VAAPI` or `x264` (ultrafast)
* Resolution: 1280x720 (720p)
* FPS: 30
* Bitrate: \~2500-3500 kbps

---

### 2. **Editing Software**

Since you'll mostly **cut long recordings** and maybe speed things up, you don’t need heavy transitions or effects.

#### ✅ **LosslessCut** (Best for long raw video trimming)

* 🚀 Perfect for long raw videos (cutting hours into highlights)
* ❌ No fancy effects or text overlays
* 📦 Install AppImage:
  [https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases)

#### ✅ **Shotcut** (for basic editing + titles)

* 🧰 Add intro/outro, overlay text like “Day 3: 3 hours coding”
* 🐌 Slower but manageable on your system
* 📦 Install:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S shotcut
  ```

#### Optional:

If you want to go extreme lightweight:

* **Kino or Avidemux** (just for slicing)

---

### 3. **Post-Production Automation (Optional)**

Once you have edited:

* You can **auto-generate YouTube titles/descriptions** using shell scripts or ChatGPT.
* Optionally use `ffmpeg` to compress output:

  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset veryfast output.mp4
  ```

---

## 📦 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Record using OBS (720p, 30fps, VAAPI)
# 2. Trim the raw video using LosslessCut
# 3. Add intro/outro/title in Shotcut (optional)
# 4. Compress final video with ffmpeg
# 5. Upload to YouTube (manual or scripted)
```

---

## 🧠 Tips for Success

* 🎤 Use a decent mic for voice (even phone headset is better than laptop mic)
* 🕓 Record in blocks (e.g. 25 min, Pomodoro style)
* 📜 Add onscreen goals ("Today: Finish FastAPI routes")
* 🪄 Use background music (optional, added in Shotcut)

### ✅ Summary

| Tool            | Purpose                | Why                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **OBS Studio**  | Record long videos     | Best balance of power and control   |
| **LosslessCut** | Trim hours of footage  | Lightning fast, minimal CPU usage   |
| **Shotcut**     | Add text/titles        | Light enough, full editing features |
| **FFmpeg**      | Compress before upload | Saves disk and upload time          |
