    i, a, o                       # Insert before/after cursor, new line below
    I, A, O                       # Insert start/end of line, new line above
    v, V, ctrl+v                  # Visual, Visual line, Visual block
    esc, ctrl+c, ctrl+[           # Exit to normal mode
    ## Text Objects & Operations
    yy, dd, cc                   # Yank/delete/change entire line
    y$, d$, c$                   # Yank/delete/change to end of line
    u, ctrl+r                    # Undo, redo (how do you live without these?!)
    .                            # Repeat last command (still useful even with mouse)
    gv                           # Reselect your last selection (handy!)
    p, P                         # Paste after/before cursor
    >>, <<                       # Indent/unindent current line
    ==                           # Auto-indent current line
    g~                           # Toggle case of selection/motion
    ## Movement Mastery  
    h,j,k,l                       # Basic movement (left,down,up,right)
    w, e, b                       # Word forward, end of word, word backward
    W, E, B                       # WORD movement (ignore punctuation)
    0, ^, $                       # Start of line, first non-blank, end of line
    gg, G                         # Go to top, go to bottom
    ctrl+u, ctrl+d               # Half page up/down
    ctrl+b, ctrl+f               # Full page up/down
    {, }                         # Previous/next paragraph
    ## Search & Replace Power
    /search_term          # Search forward
    ?search_term          # Search backward
    n                     # Next match
    N                     # Previous match
    *                     # Search word under cursor forward
    #                     # Search word under cursor backward
    ## File & Buffer Management
    :w, :w filename              # Save, save as
    :q, :q!, :wq, :x             # Quit, force quit, save & quit
    :bn, :bp                     # Next/previous buffer
    ctrl+^                       # Switch to alternate buffer
    :bd                          # Delete/close buffer
